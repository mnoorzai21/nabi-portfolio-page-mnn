 The excitement of being  a software developer motivates me to work hard. Besides the homework assignment I have really learned a lot of things from this project. This website represents my portfolio.
First of all, I made a professional portfolio for myself, second, I improved my writing of HTML and CSS codes skills and lastly, I have improved my debugging skills. This project will introduce me and will have more information about myself.
